# bangkit-notes

Storing my scrambled notes here when I participate in [Google Bangkit](https://grow.google/intl/id_id/bangkit/) Machine Learning Track as a student.

I use [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) to take notes. The vault will be backed up here automatically every 2 days.

All notes are markdown files. I took them in bits while using backlinking. If you open the files from Obsidian, the backlinks should work.

I hope this repo will be useful, at least for me in the future. 😉
