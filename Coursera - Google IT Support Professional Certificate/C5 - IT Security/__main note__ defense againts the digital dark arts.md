# The CIA Triad
model for designing security
- Confidentiality
	keeping things hidden
	- data leak
- Integrity
	keeping data accurate and untampered with
	- corrupted files
- Availability
	the information we have is readily accessible to those people that should have it
	- data loss
	- security down

# Essential Security Terms

- Bots: control other system
	- rootkit: run malicious proccesses
	- backdoors

Denial-of-Service (DoS): overwhelming a service
	- Ping of Death (PoD)
