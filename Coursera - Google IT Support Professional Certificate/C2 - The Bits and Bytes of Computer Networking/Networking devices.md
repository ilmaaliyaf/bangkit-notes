# Cables
Layer 1
## Copper
collection of twisted copper
concept: changing voltages
common types: cat5, cat5e, cat6 (number of twists  in the cable)
	problem in cat5: crosstalk
	the 
## Fiber
collection of individual optical fibers, tiny tubes from glass, width of a human hair
concet: pulses of light

# Hub and Switches
Cables only have two node, end to end. We want communicate to many.
These two usually connect to a single network (LAN, local area network)
Layer 2
## Hub
connect many computers at once, at the same time
collision domain: only one device can communicate at a time
	this makes hub rare now
	
## Switch
inspect content from a node, and only send it back to certain system

# Routers
forward data to other independent network
Layer 3

Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
	learn optimal path between routers
	

# Server and Clients
## Server
anything that provide data

## Client
anything that request data

a node can be a server and a client at the same time
