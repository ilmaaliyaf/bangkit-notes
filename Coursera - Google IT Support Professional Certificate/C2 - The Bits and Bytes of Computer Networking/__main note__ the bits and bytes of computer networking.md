## The TCP/IP Five-Layer Network Model
1. [[Physical layer]]
	connecting computers physically: cabels, connectors
2. [[Data link layer]]
	responsible for defining a common way of interpreting these signals so network devices can communicate
3. [[Network layer]]
	allows different networks to communicate with each other through devices know as routers
	- Internetwork: collection of networks connected together through routers
	- Internet Protocol (IP)
	- emails, web pages
4. [[Transport layer]]
	sorts out which client and server program are supposed to get that data
	- Transmission Control Protocol
	- User Diagram Protocol
5. [[Application layer]]
