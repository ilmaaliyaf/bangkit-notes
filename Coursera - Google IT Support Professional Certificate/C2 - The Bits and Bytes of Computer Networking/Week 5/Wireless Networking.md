A way of network without wires
IEEE 802.11 standards

Frequency band
> a certain section of the radio spectrum that's been agreed upon to be used for certain communications
- FM broadcast band


# 802.11 protocols
- defining how we operate at both the physical and the data link layers

Order of developments
- b
- a
- g
- n
- ac


# Fields
- frame control: 16 bits long, describes how the frame should be processed
- duration: how long the total frame is
- source address
- intended destination address
- recieving address
- sequence control
- transmitter address
- data payload
- data frame
- FCS


# Configurations
- Ad-hoc network
	- no actual infrastructure, computers connects to each other directly
	- phone to phone
	- industrial setting
	- suited for disaster situation
- Wireless LANs
	- some access points as bridges
- Mesh network
	- draw lines between all links and all nodes
	- increase performances and ranges

# Channels
- collision domain
	- any one network segment where one computer can interrupt another
		- all device has to stop and wait in random times


# Security
- anyone within range can interfere
- WEP (Wired equivalent privacy)
	- weak encryption, only use 40 bits key
- WPA (wi-fi protected access)
	- 
- WPA2
	- 256-bit key
- MAC filtering
	- only give access to devices you trust


# Cellular Network
- just like 802.11
- concepts of cells, no overlap
- like access points


# Mobile device
- wi-fi
- cellular
- radio signal
- short range wireless, peripheral network
	- bluetooth
